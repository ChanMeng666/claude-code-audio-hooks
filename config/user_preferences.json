    "✅ OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION - 3 Essential Hooks Enabled",
    "",
    "This is the RECOMMENDED configuration for the project's core mission:",
    "\"Alert user whenever Claude Code stops or pauses for ANY reason\"",
    "",
    "ENABLED HOOKS (3 total):",
    "",
    "1. ⚠️ Notification Hook → 'Attention! Authorization needed'",
    "   - Triggers when Claude shows 'Do you want to proceed?' prompts",
    "   - THIS IS THE KEY HOOK for permission/authorization alerts",
    "   - Audio: notification-urgent.mp3",
    "",
    "2. ✅ Stop Hook → 'Task completed successfully'",
    "   - Triggers when Claude finishes responding",
    "   - Lets you know when Claude is done working",
    "   - Audio: task-complete.mp3",
    "",
    "3. 🤖 SubagentStop Hook → 'Subagent task completed'",
    "   - Triggers when background/long-running tasks complete",
    "   - Important for Task tool operations",
    "   - Audio: subagent-complete.mp3",
    "",
    "DISABLED HOOKS (6 total) - Not needed for core functionality:",
    "",
    "❌ PreToolUse - Would play before EVERY tool (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)",
    "   Too noisy! Not needed since Notification hook already handles permission prompts.",
    "",
    "❌ PostToolUse - Would play after EVERY tool execution",
    "   Extremely noisy during development. Not needed for pause/stop detection.",
    "",
    "❌ UserPromptSubmit - Would play when you press Enter",
    "   Unnecessary confirmation. You already know when you submit a prompt.",
    "",
    "❌ PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd - Rare events, not critical",
    "",
    "WHY THIS CONFIGURATION IS OPTIMAL:",
    "- ✅ You hear audio when Claude needs your confirmation (Notification)",
    "- ✅ You hear audio when Claude finishes tasks (Stop)",
    "- ✅ You hear audio when background tasks complete (SubagentStop)",
    "- ✅ Clean and non-intrusive - only alerts when truly needed",
    "- ❌ No spam from every tool execution",
    "",
    "VERIFIED BEHAVIOR:",
    "When Claude shows 'Do you want to proceed?', Notification hook triggers",
    "and plays notification-urgent.mp3. This is the correct behavior!",
    "",
    "Run 'scripts/view-hook-log.sh' to monitor hook triggers in real-time."
